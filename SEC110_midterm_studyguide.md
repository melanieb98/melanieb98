It has come to our attention that you are transferring funds to other agencies using this computer without compliance with the local income tax laws. As per section 22 of the U.S. Income Tax Act, the transmission of funds without applicable taxes is prohibited. Your IP address is identified in this fraudulent transaction and is locked to prevent further unlawful activities. This offense attracts a penalty of $400.00 for the first offense. You are hereby given 16 hours to resolve this issue, failing which you shall be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. You may make a secure payment by clicking on the following link. If you face any issues, you may reach out to us at compliance@irs.gov.us."

A: Client-side request forgery

Q: Terrence, an executive VP of IT at sigma bank, noticed that yesterday, there was a major attack on several thousands of bank employees’ computers located at geographically different locations where files and data from the computers got deleted. It was also noticed that several confidential files containing customer data were deleted from the bank’s server in multiple locations, and the CEO’s emails were deleted from the server. Since the bank was compliant with cybersecurity measures, Terrence suspects an internal hand in this activity. While going through the records of all employees working in the IT security of the bank, both past and present, he notices that there is an employee, Chris, who has enough experience to launch this attack, was unhappy with his annual review last year, and had left the bank three months ago.
