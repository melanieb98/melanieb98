A: Client-side request forgery

Q: Terrence, an executive VP of IT at sigma bank, noticed that yesterday, there was a major attack on several thousands of bank employees’ computers located at geographically different locations where files and data from the computers got deleted. It was also noticed that several confidential files containing customer data were deleted from the bank’s server in multiple locations, and the CEO’s emails were deleted from the server. Since the bank was compliant with cybersecurity measures, Terrence suspects an internal hand in this activity. While going through the records of all employees working in the IT security of the bank, both past and present, he notices that there is an employee, Chris, who has enough experience to launch this attack, was unhappy with his annual review last year, and had left the bank three months ago.
