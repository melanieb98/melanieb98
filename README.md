##My Interests:

i used to be a professional pastry chef, in napa, california, until the covid pandemic hit and i chose to leave the food service industry. i have always had a passing interest in computer science but now i'd like to invest my time in learning how computers work so i can use them to make art and games that i can express myself through. i'm currently studying for a cybersecurity degree while i write and program games on the side. i also make music in my spare time, both digital and acoustic. i love jazz and drum & bass. i also have an adorable kitten of about 7 months!
