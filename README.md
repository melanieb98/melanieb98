## My Interests:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to be a professional pastry chef, in Napa, California, until the Covid pandemic hit and I chose to leave the food service industry. I have always had a passing interest in computer science but now I'd like to invest my time in learning how computers work so I can use them to make art and games that I can express myself through. I'm currently studying for a cybersecurity degree while I write and program games on the side. I also make music in my spare time, both digital and acoustic. I love jazz and drum & bass. I also have an adorable kitten of about 7 months!
